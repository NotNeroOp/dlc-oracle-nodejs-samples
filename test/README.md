# Oracle testbench (NodeJS)

This utility will take the testdata files generated by the Oracle library [test generator](https://github.com/mit-dci/dlc-oracle-go/tree/master/test-generator), and run the oracle library against those files. The files were generated by using the reference implementation in Go. 

The files contain the private key, one-time-signing keys, messages and expected signatures and signature pubkeys. By running this testbench we can increase our confidence about the library behaving the same as the reference implementation.
